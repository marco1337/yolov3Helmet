# Helmet detection usign YOLOv3

This repository is a test project to use the algorith YOLOv3 and train a custom object detector for Helmet.

The main objective of this project is to show a proof of concept of a PPE detector that can be used to monitor PPE usage in building constructions and avoid accidents and possible legal issues.

The model was also trained on the Google Colaboratory platform to test it.

The original website of the YOLO project can be found in: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/.

The video tutorial to train YOLOv3 on the cloud using Google Colab is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10joRJt39Ns . This video was done by TheAIGuy and is a good start for training a YOLOv3 model if you don't have a powerful GPU available.

This repository also includes the dataset used and the final file with the weights of the model trained.
